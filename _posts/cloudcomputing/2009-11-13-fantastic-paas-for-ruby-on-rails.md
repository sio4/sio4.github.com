Ruby on Rails 개발자를 겨냥한 상용 PaaS(Platform as a Service)
서비스이다. 대충 봐도 멋지네! 다음에 찬찬히 들여다보자.

[Heroku \| Heroku Documentation](http://docs.heroku.com/)

> Heroku is a platform for instant deployment of Ruby/Rails web apps.  
>   
> Heroku is a completely novel approach to deploying web applications. Forget about servers; the fundamental unit is the app. Use the Heroku client gem to create and manage apps from the command line. Then deploy your code with Git, and control the running app with the remote Ruby console and rake commands.
