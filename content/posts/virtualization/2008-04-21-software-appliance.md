확실히, 이젠 소프트웨어 어플라이언스가 대세다. 다만, 그 시장성을 어떻게
키울 수 있을지가 아직 숙제라면 숙제.

소프트웨어 어플라이언스, 소프트웨어 어플라이언스용 OS, JeOS로써의 리눅스.
이미 rPath나 JumpBox 등의 SA 전용 Base OS가 시장을 형성하고 있는데,
이제는 Major 배포본도 가상화 시대에 맞춰 움직임을 보이고 있는 듯 하다.


[Just enough operating system - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Just_enough_operating_system)

> JeOS is the abbreviation (pronounced "juice") for the concept of Just Enough Operating System as it applies to a software appliance.  

[Ubuntu Server Edition JeOS \| Ubuntu](http://www.ubuntu.com/products/whatisubuntu/serveredition/jeos)   

> Ubuntu Server Edition JeOS (pronounced "Juice") is an efficient variant of our server operating system, configured specifically for virtual appliances. Currently available as a CD-Rom ISO for download, JeOS is a specialised installation of Ubuntu Server Edition with a tuned kernel that only contains the base elements needed to run within a virtualized environment.  

[redhat.com \| Red Hat Appliance Operating System](http://www.redhat.com/solutions/aos/)   

> The Red Hat Appliance Operating System allows ISVs to distribute their applications pre-packaged as complete solutions, simplifying deployment, management and maintenance for their end users.  

[SUSE Appliance Program](http://www.novell.com/linux2/appliance/)   

> The SUSE® Appliance Program enables independent software vendors (ISVs) to bundle their applications with a subset of the SUSE Linux Enterprise platform and deliver the bundle as a software appliance.  

[Limejeos - openSUSE](http://en.opensuse.org/Limejeos)   

> Lime Jeos (pronounced like lime juice) is a project for building a base for [appliances]. Actually it is part of the cocktail.lin.cat project, a project for building software appliances based on openSUSE.  

[Get Juiced! - The Console](http://blogs.vmware.com/console/2007/07/get-juiced.html)   

> Just what the heck is Juice? Juice is the pronunciation for JeOS, which stands for “Just Enough OS.” So, why should you care about JeOS, or Just Enough of the OS? Why would you install JeOS instead of the full blown general purpose operating system? Before I get into the details, I want to clarify that this is not an operating system that VMware is developing, marketing or selling. JeOS is a concept for what an operating system should look like in the context of a virtual appliance.
