EC2, S3 등을 시작으로 계속해서 새로운 서비스를 발표하면서 클라우드 컴퓨팅
산업을 선도해오고 있는 Amazon이 이번엔 Relational Database 를 역시

[Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS)](http://aws.amazon.com/rds/)

> Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS) is a web service that makes it easy to set up, operate, and scale a relational database in the cloud. It provides cost-efficient and resizable capacity while managing time-consuming database administration tasks, freeing you up to focus on your applications and business.

> Amazon RDS gives you access to the full capabilities of a familiar MySQL database. This means the code, applications, and tools you already use today with your existing MySQL databases work seamlessly with Amazon RDS. Amazon RDS automatically patches the database software and backs up your database, storing the backups for a user-defined retention period. You also benefit from the flexibility of being able to scale the compute resources or storage capacity associated with your relational database instance via a single API call. As with all Amazon Web Services, there are no up-front investments required, and you pay only for the resources you use.
