클라우드 컴퓨팅이라는 것이 본질적으로 오픈소스 세계와 일맥 상통하는 바가
있다. 어거지인가? 모든 IT 벤더들이 자신들과 관계가 있다고 할테지만,...
어쨌든 클라우트 컴퓨팅이라는 개념의 바닥에 깔린 근본적 취지는 오픈소스
세계의 것과 잘 어울린다.

> The momentum in technology often picks up when developers converge to
> create Open Source solutions that can be used to solve interoperability
> issues. Arguably this is not required to be Open Source but I am of the
> mind that something magical happens when Open Source is the catalyst
> (e.g. "The Internet" Boom after the proprietary PC market had to contend
> with Linux...). When Open Source has the backing of an organization that
> is built around prospering with it the "stars begin to align".

[Red Hat News \| Introducing Deltacloud](http://press.redhat.com/2009/09/03/introducing-deltacloud/)

> The initiation of a new open source project within Red Hat is certainly
> not news. It’s an established expectation within our engineering ranks.
> It’s how we advance and develop software.
> 
> Every once in a while, though, a new project breaks through the norm of
> business as usual. Something special. Creating a buzz.
> 
> Today that project is [http://deltacloud.org](http://deltacloud.org).
> 
> The goal is simple. To enable an ecosystem of developers, tools, scripts,
> and applications which can interoperate across the public and private clouds.

> Start an instance on an internal cloud, then with the same code start
> another on EC2 or Rackspace. Deltacloud protects your apps from cloud
> API changes and incompatibilities, so you can concentrate on managing
> cloud instances the way you want
